## Problem

As LLMs become embedded in production systems, prompt injection represents a critical security risk. PromptGuard acts as an intelligent middleware layer between user inputs and LLM backends — protecting against injection, jailbreaks, and unsafe interactions.

## Approach

Multi-layer validation: pattern matching for known signatures, semantic AI-based intent detection, and an adaptive filtering engine that learns from emerging attack patterns.
